1. Undefined because the declaration will be hoisted,
but it still wont have a value.

2.magnet because of the scope of the function.

3. super cool because the function print is not called.

4. i think it will  log both chicken and half-chicken.

5. I think it will throw an error because only the declaration
of the mean is hoisted, meaning that when mean() is called, it
still is not defined.

6.  It will first log undefined because the declaration not the
value is hoisted. Then it will log both rock and r&b because of the
scope of the function. Then it will log disco as the global scope.

7. It will do the same thing as the last one, except the first log will be San Jose
because it is given a value. Seattle and Burbank will be logged inside the function,
then San Jose again.
